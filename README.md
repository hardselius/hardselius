### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Stuff

- I keep a very barebones [resume][resume] online. Nothing fancy. Just text.
- Once in a while I turn something interesting into a [gist][gists], mainly for
  future me who forgot how to do something.
- I have a [blog][blog] that I haven't updated in a while. I'm not sure it's
  for me. We'll see.
